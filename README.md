# parcel-template with TS, SASS, Bootstrap, JQuery and fontawesome


This is a starter workflow for building simples web applications using Parcel V2 with sass, typescript, bootstrap

JQuery and fontawesome.

I build this starter template because I often want to build web applications using a simple structure but 

at the same time being able to have security and code modularization.

In the end being able to generate a lightweight bundle that runs efficiently on the server, a bit similar to the 

directory structuring of frameworks known as angular, vue or react but simpler, all this is

possible using the parcel js with zero configuration. 

I recommend this starter template for beginners, at the same for all who want to build simple applications like a landing page 

or something like that.

To use this starter the only thing we need to do is install dependencies and run the development server 

or generate the final bundle.

# Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run dev server - http://localhost:1234

```
npm start
```

Build assets for production

```
npm run build
```
